### Project Objective

##### Objective and Questions
The goal of our project was to use data from the TMDB website to learn more about several questions. As avid movie watchers, we wanted to learn more about how the genre of a movie relates to the box office earnings of a movie or if attributes such as earnings, director, genre, release date, or runtime could be used to predict the rating score of a movie? 

#### Models and Usage
This repo contains 6 main files demonstrating each of the best models we found to address our two main questions of 'how does genre affect the success/earnings of a movie?' and 'what elements make a good movie: how much money it makes, how high itâ€™s rating is, star power, and how long the movie is?" These models as follows: Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XG Boost, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, Recurrent Neural Network, and Cluster Analysis.
